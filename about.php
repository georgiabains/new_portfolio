			<p>My name is Georgia Bains and I've been designing & developing websites since 2014. I taught myself the basics of coding while creating themes for the platform Tumblr, and I've since extended those skills into developing WordPress themes, static pages, and sites on ExpressionEngine. I focus on accessible and responsive design and development, so that anyone can access your website from anywhere.</p>
